# 🤔 Why Papermap?

The goal of **Papermap** is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly platform to check the current scientific consensus on various topics, particularly those that are often debated or surrounded by misinformation in public discourse.

Sharing the link or image version of a **Papermap** map can also help inform discussions and decisions based on evidence rather than opinions or anecdotal experiences.

## 📰 Papermap VS a newspaper article

Newspapers are often politically biased, and their articles are usually based on weak evidence such as testimonials, opinions, a single study, or other newspaper articles.

**Papermap** aims to be as unbiased as possible by allowing anyone to contribute, and to be based on the strongest evidence possible by approximating the scientific consensus.

## 🧑‍🏫 Papermap VS an expert opinion

Expert opinions are not considered strong evidence compared to scientific studies. There is no clear definition of who is an "expert", and you can always find someone called an "expert" to support any opinion.

**Papermap** relies as little as possible on opinions, and instead focuses on experimental results from scientific studies, aggregating as much evidence as possible to approximate the scientific consensus.

## 📃 Papermap VS a scientific study

A single scientific study is not enough to draw definitive conclusions. Almost all topics have at least one outlier study that contradicts the consensus.

**Papermap** avoids this by aggregating as many relevant studies as possible, making it easier to distinguish between the general trend and outliers.

## 📖 Papermap VS a literature review

Literature reviews also aggregate multiple scientific studies in addition to providing expert criticism and meta-analysis. But they can be outdated or based on a limited number of papers. Thus, as with original studies, most topics have at least one outlier review that contradicts the consensus.

**Papermap** compensates for its lack of expert criticism and meta-analysis by also including literature reviews in its maps (as many as possible), making it easier to distinguish between the general trend and outliers, even among reviews.
